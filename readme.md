# Canteen Management System

## Project Overview
The **Canteen Management System** is a GUI-based desktop application built using Java, JDBC, MySQL, and Java Swing. It is designed to simplify and streamline canteen operations by providing two distinct modes: **Admin** and **Employee**. The Admin mode allows management of product details and employee records, while the Employee mode facilitates order placement and bill generation.

- **Statistics**: View product statistics for better inventory tracking and management.

### Employee Mode
- **Order Placement**: Employees can place orders for canteen products.
- **Bill Generation**: Automatic bill generation for placed orders.
- **Statistics Viewing**: Employees can view basic statistics like order history and sales data.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/canteen-management-system.git
   ```

4. **Configure the Database**:
   - Install MySQL.
   - Run the following SQL script to create the database and necessary tables:

     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE CMSDATA;

     USE CMSDATA;

     CREATE TABLE STOCK (
         PRODUCT_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
         PRODUCT_NAME VARCHAR(50),
         PORTION_SIZE VARCHAR(50),
         DISCOUNT INT,
         PRICE INT,
         TOTAL_QTY INT
     );

     CREATE TABLE CUSTOMER (
         FIRST_NAME VARCHAR(50),
         LAST_NAME VARCHAR(50),
         PHONE_NO BIGINT,
         TOTAL_AMOUNT INT,
         TOTAL_DISCOUNT INT,
         PAID_AMOUNT INT,
         DATE_OF_PURCHASE DATE DEFAULT (CURRENT_DATE)
     );

     CREATE TABLE PURCHASED (
         PRODUCT_NAME VARCHAR(50),
         PORTION_SIZE VARCHAR(50),
         DISCOUNT INT,
         PRICE INT,
         TOTAL_QTY INT
     );

     CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEES (
         ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
         FIRST_NAME VARCHAR(50),
         LAST_NAME VARCHAR(50),
         PHONE_NO BIGINT,
         EMAIL_ID VARCHAR(50),
         PASSWORD VARCHAR(50)
     );
     ```
   
3. **Add MySQL Connector**:
   - Download the MySQL JDBC Connector and add it to your project dependencies.
  
4. **Change the connectivity details**:
   - Navigate to `src/JDBC/JdbcConnectivity.java` and change the username and password according to your database configuration.
 

5. **Run the Application**:
   - Open the project in your IDE.
   - Run the `login.java` file to launch the application.

6. **Admin Mode Default Id and Password**:
   - id:123
   - password:Pass@123
